Features of the Provider View:
- A cell can be selected by clicking on it. The cell is then highlighted blue.
- The full formula of a selected cell is displayed in a text box above the spreadsheet.
- The dislayed formula can be edited, and the edits can be confirmed or rejected by using the two toolbar buttons
to the left of the text box.
- The user can scroll indefinitely in the vertical and horizontal directions, and cells past the edge of the screen can be edited.
- When cells are edited any affected cells are updated immediately.

Provider View Style Errors:
   In MyKeyListener.java, in the provider.view package, I am losing 9 style points for missing Javadoc, badly formatted code,
   and uncommented empty method bodies. I would like these points back as the errors are not within code that I have written
   and I cannot edit the provider's code to fix them.
